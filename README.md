## Display Property Project

## Section with a nice underlined Title as a building block of a webpage

#### I liked the way this very simple project looked so I've decided to place it on GitHub repo... maybe for the future reference.

This project is part of the Udemy courese: [HTML&CSS Tutorial and Projects Course (Flexbox&Grid)](https://www.udemy.com/course/in-depth-html-css-course-build-responsive-websites/) by [John Smilga](https://www.udemy.com/user/janis-smilga-3/)


### Below is the original challenge assignment:
#### Setup

- create folder (06-display-property)
- create index.html, general structure
- give it a title (display property)
- create css file (main.css)
- link to css file in html (head element)

#### HTML (structure)

- create div with class "section"
  - inside setup
    - div with class "section-title"
      - inside setup
      - h1
      - div with class "title-underline"
    - div with class "section-center"
      - inside setup
      - p

#### CSS (styles)

- setup reset
- select body, add system fonts, background (#f1f5f9), line height

- select section, add padding, background (#fff)

- select "section-title", add text-align, text-transform

- select .title-underline, add height, width, background, place in the center, add margin in the bottom

- select section center, add width (90vw), max-width (1170px), place in the center

#### Questions

- Why section title in a separate div?
- Why 90vw and 1170px?
- The purpose of section-center
- Examples
